## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Vyacheslav Podolskiy** and I'm computer software engineer. I'm 3rd year bachelor student at ITMO University. I'm a backend developer focused on Java and Kotlin. Passionate about staying on top of industry trends and integrating modern approaches into development processes. Open to active project involvement and driven by continuous growthâ€”both technically and personally.

### My projects
Developed the backend for a visual novel game [LogicNovelMystery](https://github.com/Vad1mChK/LogicNovelMystery) using Spring framework, focusing on scalable architecture, game logic processing, and seamless interaction with the frontend.

Developed several microservices in pure Kotlin for a collaborative healthy lifestyle app project (code name: [**happ**](https://github.com/BARSHunters/happ-backend)). Focused on clean architecture, service communication, and maintainability.

You can find more of my projects and contributions in my GitHub [Repositories](https://github.com/DemonM1x?tab=repositories).
